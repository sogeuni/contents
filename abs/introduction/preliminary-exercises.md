1. System administrators often write scripts to automate common tasks. Give several instances where such scripts would be useful.
2. Write a script that upon invocation shows the [[time-date-commands#^DATEREF|time and date]], [[system-and-administrative-commands#^WHOREF|lists all logged-in users]], and gives the system [[system-and-administrative-commands#^UPTIMEREF|uptime]]. The script then [[io-redirection#^IOREDIRREF|saves this information]] to a logfile.
