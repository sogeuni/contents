title: 4.4. Special Variable Types
---

## _Local variables_

Variables [[subshells#^SCOPEREF|visible]] only within a [[special-characters#^CODEBLOCKREF|code block]] or function (see also [[local-variables#^LOCALREF|local variables]] in [[functions|functions]])

## _Environmental variables_

Variables that affect the behavior of the shell and user interface

> [!note]
> In a more general context, each [[special-characters#^PROCESSREF|process]] has an "environment", that is, a group of variables that the process may reference. In this sense, the shell behaves like any other process.
> 
> Every time a shell starts, it creates shell variables that correspond to its own environmental variables. Updating or adding new environmental variables causes the shell to update its environment, and all the shell's _child processes_ (the commands it executes) inherit this environment.

> [!caution]
> The space allotted to the environment is limited. Creating too many environmental variables or ones that use up excessive space may cause problems.
>
> ```bash
> bash$ eval "`seq 10000 | sed -e 's/.*/export var&=ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ/'`"
> 
> bash$ du
> bash: /usr/bin/du: Argument list too long
> ```
>
> Note: this "error" has been fixed, as of kernel version 2.6.23.

If a script sets environmental variables, they need to be "exported," that is, reported to the _environment_ local to the script. This is the function of the [[internal-commands-and-builtins#^EXPORTREF|export]] command.

> [!note]
> A script can **export** variables only to child [[special-characters#^PROCESSREF|processes]], that is, only to commands or processes which that particular script initiates. A script invoked from the command-line _cannot_ export variables back to the command-line environment. _[[internal-commands-and-builtins#^FORKREF|Child processes]] cannot export variables back to the parent processes that spawned them._
>
> **Definition:** A _child process_ is a subprocess launched by another process, its [[internal-commands-and-builtins#^PARENTREF|parent]].|

## _Positional parameters_

Arguments passed to the script from the command line [^1] : $0, $1, $2, $3 . . .

$0 is the name of the script itself, $1 is the first argument, $2 the second, $3 the third, and so forth. [^2] After $9, the arguments must be enclosed in brackets, for example, ${10}, ${11}, ${12}.

The special variables [[internal-variables#^APPREF|$* and $@]] denote _all_ the positional parameters.

###### Example 4-5. Positional Parameters

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Call this script with at least 10 parameters, for example
# ./scriptname 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
MINPARAMS=10

echo

echo "The name of this script is \"$0\"."
# Adds ./ for current directory
echo "The name of this script is \"`basename $0`\"."
# Strips out path name info (see 'basename')

echo

if [ -n "$1" ]              # Tested variable is quoted.
then
 echo "Parameter #1 is $1"  # Need quotes to escape #
fi 

if [ -n "$2" ]
then
 echo "Parameter #2 is $2"
fi 

if [ -n "$3" ]
then
 echo "Parameter #3 is $3"
fi 

# ...


if [ -n "${10}" ]  # Parameters > $9 must be enclosed in {brackets}.
then
 echo "Parameter #10 is ${10}"
fi 

echo "-----------------------------------"
echo "All the command-line parameters are: "$*""

if [ $# -lt "$MINPARAMS" ]
then
  echo
  echo "This script needs at least $MINPARAMS command-line arguments!"
fi  

echo

exit 0
```

_Bracket notation_ for positional parameters leads to a fairly simple way of referencing the _last_ argument passed to a script on the command-line. This also requires [[bashver2#^VARREFNEW|indirect referencing]].

```bash
args=$#           # Number of args passed.
lastarg=${!args}
# Note: This is an *indirect reference* to $args ...


# Or:       lastarg=${!#}             (Thanks, Chris Monson.)
# This is an *indirect reference* to the $# variable.
# Note that lastarg=${!$#} doesn't work.
```

Some scripts can perform different operations, depending on which name they are invoked with. For this to work, the script needs to check $0, the name it was invoked by. [^3] There must also exist symbolic links to all the alternate names of the script. See [[basic-commands#^HELLOL|Example 16-2]].

> [!tip]
> If a script expects a command-line parameter but is invoked without one, this may cause a _null variable assignment_, generally an undesirable result. One way to prevent this is to append an extra character to both sides of the assignment statement using the expected positional parameter.

```bash
variable1_=$1_  # Rather than variable1=$1
# This will prevent an error, even if positional parameter is absent.

critical_argument01=$variable1_

# The extra character can be stripped off later, like so.
variable1=${variable1_/_/}
# Side effects only if $variable1_ begins with an underscore.
# This uses one of the parameter substitution templates discussed later.
# (Leaving out the replacement pattern results in a deletion.)

#  A more straightforward way of dealing with this is
#+ to simply test whether expected positional parameters have been passed.
if [ -z $1 ]
then
  exit $E_MISSING_POS_PARAM
fi


#  However, as Fabian Kreutz points out,
#+ the above method may have unexpected side-effects.
#  A better method is parameter substitution:
#         ${1:-$DefaultVal}
#  See the "Parameter Substition" section
#+ in the "Variables Revisited" chapter.
```

###### Example 4-6. _wh_, *whois* domain name lookup

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ex18.sh

# Does a 'whois domain-name' lookup on any of 3 alternate servers:
#                    ripe.net, cw.net, radb.net

# Place this script -- renamed 'wh' -- in /usr/local/bin

# Requires symbolic links:
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-ripe
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-apnic
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-tucows

E_NOARGS=75


if [ -z "$1" ]
then
  echo "Usage: `basename $0` [domain-name]"
  exit $E_NOARGS
fi

# Check script name and call proper server.
case `basename $0` in    # Or:    case ${0##*/} in
    "wh"       ) whois $1@whois.tucows.com;;
    "wh-ripe"  ) whois $1@whois.ripe.net;;
    "wh-apnic" ) whois $1@whois.apnic.net;;
    "wh-cw"    ) whois $1@whois.cw.net;;
    *          ) echo "Usage: `basename $0` [domain-name]";;
esac 

exit $?
```

The **shift** command reassigns the positional parameters, in effect shifting them to the left one notch.

$1 <--- $2, $2 <--- $3, $3 <--- $4, etc.

The old $1 disappears, but _$0 (the script name) does not change_. If you use a large number of positional parameters to a script, **shift** lets you access those past 10, although [[othertypesv#^BRACKETNOTATION|{bracket} notation]] also permits this.

###### Example 4-7. Using *shift*

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# shft.sh: Using 'shift' to step through all the positional parameters.

#  Name this script something like shft.sh,
#+ and invoke it with some parameters.
#+ For example:
#             sh shft.sh a b c def 83 barndoor

until [ -z "$1" ]  # Until all parameters used up . . .
do
  echo -n "$1 "
  shift
done

echo               # Extra linefeed.

# But, what happens to the "used-up" parameters?
echo "$2"
#  Nothing echoes!
#  When $2 shifts into $1 (and there is no $3 to shift into $2)
#+ then $2 remains empty.
#  So, it is not a parameter *copy*, but a *move*.

exit

#  See also the echo-params.sh script for a "shiftless"
#+ alternative method of stepping through the positional params.
```

The **shift** command can take a numerical parameter indicating how many positions to shift.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# shift-past.sh

shift 3    # Shift 3 positions.
#  n=3; shift $n
#  Has the same effect.

echo "$1"

exit 0

# ======================== #


$ sh shift-past.sh 1 2 3 4 5
4

#  However, as Eleni Fragkiadaki, points out,
#+ attempting a 'shift' past the number of
#+ positional parameters ($#) returns an exit status of 1,
#+ and the positional parameters themselves do not change.
#  This means possibly getting stuck in an endless loop. . . .
#  For example:
#      until [ -z "$1" ]
#      do
#         echo -n "$1 "
#         shift 20    #  If less than 20 pos params,
#      done           #+ then loop never ends!
#
# When in doubt, add a sanity check. . . .
#           shift 20 || break
#                    ^^^^^^^^
```

> [!note] The **shift** command works in a similar fashion on parameters passed to a [[functions|function]]. See [[assortedtips#^MULTIPLICATION|Example 36-18]].

[^1]: Note that [[complex-functions-and-function-complexities#^PASSEDARGS|_functions_ also take positional parameters]].

[^2]: The process calling the script sets the $0 parameter. By convention, this parameter is the name of the script. See the [[basic-commands#^MANREF|manpage]] (manual page) for **execv**.

    From the _command-line_, however, $0 is the name of the shell.

    ```bash
    bash$ echo $0
    bash

    tcsh% echo $0
    tcsh
    ```

[^3]: If the the script is [[internal-commands-and-builtins#^SOURCEREF|sourced]] or [[basic-commands#^SYMLINKREF|symlinked]], then this will not work. It is safer to check [[debugging#^BASHSOURCEREF|$BASH_Source]].
