title: 7. Tests

Every reasonably complete programming language can test for a condition, then act according to the result of the test. Bash has the [[test-constructs#^TTESTREF|test]] command, various [[test-constructs#^DBLBRACKETS|bracket]] and [[test-constructs#^DBLPARENSTST|parenthesis]] operators, and the **if/then** construct.
