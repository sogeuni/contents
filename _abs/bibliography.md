Edited by Peter Denning, _Computers Under Attack: Intruders, Worms, and Viruses_, ACM Press, 1990, 0-201-53067-8.

This compendium contains a couple of articles on shell script viruses.

*

Ken Burtch, _[Linux Shell Scripting with Bash](http://www.samspublishing.com/title/0672326426)_, 1st edition, Sams Publishing (Pearson), 2004, 0672326426.

Covers much of the same material as the _ABS Guide_, though in a different style.

*

Daniel Goldman, _[Definitive Guide to Sed](http://www.sed-book.com/)_, 1st edition, 2013.

This ebook is an excellent introduction to _sed_. Rather than being a conversion from a printed volume, it was specifically designed and formatted for viewing on an ebook reader. Well-written, informative, and useful as a reference as well as a tutorial. Highly recommended.

*

Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins, _Sed and Awk_, 2nd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 1997, 1-156592-225-5.

Unfolding the full power of shell scripting requires at least a passing familiarity with [[Appendix C. A Sed and Awk Micro-Primer#^SEDREF|_sed_ and _awk_]]. This is the classic tutorial. It includes an excellent introduction to _Regular Expressions_. Recommended.

*

Jeffrey Friedl, _Mastering Regular Expressions_, O'Reilly and Associates, 2002, 0-596-00289-0.

Still the best all-around reference on [[regexp#^REGEXREF|Regular Expressions]].

*

Aeleen Frisch, _Essential System Administration_, 3rd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 2002, 0-596-00343-9.

This excellent manual provides a decent introduction to shell scripting from a sys admin point of view. It includes comprehensive explanations of the startup and initialization scripts in a UNIX system.

*

Stephen Kochan and Patrick Wood, _Unix Shell Programming_, Hayden, 1990, 067248448X.

Still considered a standard reference, though somewhat dated, and a bit "wooden" stylistically speaking. [^1] In fact, this book was the _ABS Guide_ author's first exposure to UNIX shell scripting, lo these many years ago.

*

Neil Matthew and Richard Stones, _Beginning Linux Programming_, Wrox Press, 1996, 1874416680.

Surprisingly good in-depth coverage of various programming languages available for Linux, including a fairly strong chapter on shell scripting.

*

Herbert Mayer, _Advanced C Programming on the IBM PC_, Windcrest Books, 1989, 0830693637.

Excellent coverage of algorithms and general programming practices. Highly recommended, but unfortunately out of print.

*

David Medinets, _Unix Shell Programming Tools_, McGraw-Hill, 1999, 0070397333.

Pretty good treatment of shell scripting, with examples, and a short intro to Tcl and Perl.

*

Cameron Newham and Bill Rosenblatt, _Learning the Bash Shell_, 2nd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 1998, 1-56592-347-2.

This is a valiant effort at a decent shell primer, but sadly deficient in its coverage of writing scripts and lacking sufficient examples.

*

Anatole Olczak, _Bourne Shell Quick Reference Guide_, ASP, Inc., 1991, 093573922X.

A very handy pocket reference, despite lacking coverage of Bash-specific features.

*

Jerry Peek, Tim O'Reilly, and Mike Loukides, _Unix Power Tools_, 3rd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, Random House, 2002, 0-596-00330-7.

Contains a couple of sections of very informative in-depth articles on shell programming, but falls short of being a self-teaching manual. It reproduces much of the [[regexp#^REGEXREF|Regular Expressions]] tutorial from the Dougherty and Robbins book, above. The comprehensive coverage of UNIX commands makes this book worthy of a place on your bookshelf.

*

Clifford Pickover, _Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty_, St. Martin's Press, 1990, 0-312-04123-3.

A treasure trove of ideas and recipes for computer-based exploration of mathematical oddities.

*

George Polya, _How To Solve It_, Princeton University Press, 1973, 0-691-02356-5.

The classic tutorial on problem-solving methods (algorithms), with special emphasis on how to teach them.

*

Chet Ramey and Brian Fox, _[The GNU Bash Reference Manual](http://www.network-theory.co.uk/bash/manual/)_, Network Theory Ltd, 2003, 0-9541617-7-7.

This manual is the definitive reference for GNU Bash. The authors of this manual, Chet Ramey and Brian Fox, are the original developers of GNU Bash. For each copy sold, the publisher donates $1 to the Free Software Foundation.

*

Arnold Robbins, _Bash Reference Card_, SSC, 1998, 1-58731-010-5.

Excellent Bash pocket reference (don't leave home without it, especially if you're a sysadmin). A bargain at $4.95, but unfortunately no longer available for free download.

*

Arnold Robbins, _Effective Awk Programming_, Free Software Foundation / O'Reilly and Associates, 2000, 1-882114-26-4.

The absolute best [[C.2. Awk#^AWKREF|awk]] tutorial and reference. The free electronic version of this book is part of the _awk_ documentation, and printed copies of the latest version are available from O'Reilly and Associates.

This book served as an inspiration for the author of the _ABS Guide_.

*

Bill Rosenblatt, _Learning the Korn Shell_, O'Reilly and Associates, 1993, 1-56592-054-6.

This well-written book contains some excellent pointers on shell scripting in general.

*

Paul Sheer, _LINUX: Rute User's Tutorial and Exposition_, 1st edition, , 2002, 0-13-033351-4.

Very detailed and readable introduction to Linux system administration.

The book is available in print, or [on-line](http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/linux/rute/rute.htm).

*

Ellen Siever and the staff of O'Reilly and Associates, _Linux in a Nutshell_, 2nd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 1999, 1-56592-585-8.

The all-around best Linux command reference. It even has a Bash section.

*

Dave Taylor, _Wicked Cool Shell Scripts: 101 Scripts for Linux, Mac OS X, and Unix Systems_, 1st edition, No Starch Press, 2004, 1-59327-012-7.

Pretty much what the title promises . . .

*

_The UNIX CD Bookshelf_, 3rd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 2003, 0-596-00392-7.

An array of seven UNIX books on CD ROM, including _UNIX Power Tools_, _Sed and Awk_, and _Learning the Korn Shell_. A complete set of all the UNIX references and tutorials you would ever need at about $130. Buy this one, even if it means going into debt and not paying the rent.

Update: Seems to have somehow fallen out of print. Ah, well. You can still buy the dead-tree editions of these books.

*

The O'Reilly books on Perl. (Actually, _any_ O'Reilly books.)

[^1]: It was hard to resist the obvious pun. No slight intended, since the book is a pretty decent introduction to the basic concepts of shell scripting.
